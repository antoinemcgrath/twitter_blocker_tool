# [![9.9]] twitter_blocker_tool :seedling: 
A python tool for blocking verified accounts. 

This python3 script uses tweepy and the Twitter API. 


Functional notes:

    1. This script will access 3 Twitter user lists, affirm verified users and block them. The three lists are:
       A. the Twitter managed verified user list
       B. the users followers list
       C. the followers list of "@Twitter"

    2. You may protect verified accounts (exclude them from being blocked) by creating the Twitter list "exceptions" and adding users to it. 
    This script has been built to observe rate limits and to use Twitter's API respectfully. 
    3. This script has been run for over 4 hours with no sign of interuption. 
    4. I estimate that after running this script for 20 hours 300,000 verified users will have been blocked. At this point the user should exeperience the desired Twitter experience even though new acccounts will be verified regularly.
    5. This script can be interupted and once restarted will skip previosuly blocked accounts.
    6. This script
